Next, we want to take a closer look at temporal patterns and seasonal trends, starting with the connections over the course of a day. As you can see in Figure X, most of the connections take place after midday, fade out during the night and are very low in the morning. This behaviour seems strange. Especially if you consider the case of the private site used by the employees of a company. It should be noted that the times in this dataset are measured in GMT. However, Los Angeles is in a different time zone, GMT-8. By recalculating the connection time, we get a much more reasonable graph. On average, most connections take place at 6 o'clock and are relatively even throughout the rest of the day. During the night, however, there are zero or very few connections.
A pattern can also be recognised over the course of a week. The number of connections is highest on average during working days, especially from Tuesday to Thursday inclusive. One possible explanation for the slight, yet significantly lower values on Mondays and Fridays is probably the higher popularity of working from home on these days. The number of connections drops sharply at the weekend.
We should consider opening our view to a yearly perspective when looking at trends on a monthly basis. In both 2018 and 2019, we can observe many ups and downs in the number of connections per month. But they are all quite regular around 2000 connections, except for an outlier in October 2018. Suddenly, at the beginning of 2020, we can observe a huge downward trend that does not seem to recover until 2021. The coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, and the first lockdown in the US began in March of that year.
However, no seasonal trends can be observed in relation to the seasons. The assumption that the car is increasingly used as a means of transport, particularly in winter, and is used less in summer, cannot be confirmed.
